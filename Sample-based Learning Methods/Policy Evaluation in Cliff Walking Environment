    "# Assignment: Policy Evaluation in Cliff Walking Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Course 2 Module 2 Programming Assignment! In this assignment, you will implement one of the fundamental sample and bootstrapping based model free reinforcement learning agents for prediction. This is namely one that uses one-step temporal difference learning, also known as TD(0). The task is to design an agent for policy evaluation in the Cliff Walking environment. Recall that policy evaluation is the prediction problem where the goal is to accurately estimate the values of states given some policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Implement parts of the Cliff Walking environment, to get experience specifying MDPs [Section 1].\n",
    "- Implement an agent that uses bootstrapping and, particularly, TD(0) [Section 2].\n",
    "- Apply TD(0) to estimate value functions for different policies, i.e., run policy evaluation experiments [Section 3]."

    "## The Cliff Walking Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cliff Walking environment is a gridworld with a discrete state space and discrete action space. The agent starts at grid cell S. The agent can move (deterministically) to the four neighboring cells by taking actions Up, Down, Left or Right. Trying to move out of the boundary results in staying in the same location. So, for example, trying to move left when at a cell on the leftmost column results in no movement at all and the agent remains in the same location. The agent receives -1 reward per step in most states, and -100 reward when falling off of the cliff. This is an episodic task; termination occurs when the agent reaches the goal grid cell G. Falling off of the cliff results in resetting to the start state, without termination.\n",

    "Congratulations, you have completed assignment 2! In this assignment, we investigated a very useful concept for sample-based online learning: temporal difference. We particularly looked at the prediction problem where the goal is to find the value function corresponding to a given policy. In the next assignment, by learning the action-value function instead of the state-value function, you will get to see how temporal difference learning can be used in control as well."
